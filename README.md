# Planetary-Metabolism-OS (PM-OS)
> **Updated: 2026-02-05**

## 🌍 Mission: Fixing Planetary Metabolism
We redefine climate action as a **Biological Transformation**. PM-OS is a decentralized infrastructure designed to restore Earth’s carbon/nitrogen cycles using the **MBT55 Microbial Hypercycle**.

## ⚡ Answering the "Gates Challenge"
Bill Gates stated: *"There is no equivalent of carbon capture for nitrous oxide (N₂O)."*
**Our Answer:** Don't capture—**Bypass.** MBT55 stabilizes nitrogen into organic humus within 24 hours, preventing N₂O gasification.

## 💰 Beyond the Investment Gap (Rockefeller Response)
"Funding shortage is a result, not a starting point." By flipping the **Green Premium** to a negative value through waste upcycling, we solve the investment gap at the root.
